# Flow_Direction_Correction

Flow direction toolkit: Matlab scripts for flow direction corrections

Software for manually correcting flow directions derived from a DEM using GIS tools such as ArcMap or GRASS GIS. Plots flow directions along with river centerlines and allows the user to make manual corrections.

## Inputs
flow direction raster, river centerlines shapefile, gauge coordinates (optional)

## Sample data
Includes two sets of sample data: one using geographic coordinates and one using no coordinate system in particular, but which can be used for projected coordinate systems.
